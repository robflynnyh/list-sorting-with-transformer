# Learned Backward Rules for Shortcut Resistance

## Research question

Can a small clean dataset train a reusable backward credit-assignment rule that
extracts the genuine signal from a much larger dataset containing a perfect
answer shortcut?

The forward model is trained only on shortcut-containing examples. EGGROLL
optimizes a shared learned backward rule using fitness measured on 512 clean
examples. The forward model is reset to a newly sampled initialization every
EGGROLL generation; only the backward rule persists.

## Confirmed design

- Task: retrieve the list value immediately following `<PTR>`.
- Biased input: the correct target also appears after `<LEAK>`, immediately
  before `<QUERY>`.
- Clean fitness data: 256 examples with `<LEAK> <MASK>` and 256 with a random
  incorrect leaked value.
- Values: digits 0-9.
- Lengths: sampled uniformly from 8 through 32, with no initial length
  extrapolation objective.
- Forward model: three-layer, width-128, four-head causal decoder Transformer
  with RoPE, SwiGLU, pre-norm, and no dropout.
- Forward optimizer: Adam with constant learning rate and no weight decay.
- Backward rule: one shared two-layer, width-128, four-head reverse-causal
  Transformer. It consumes saved forward activations, upstream gradients, and
  a layer identity.
- Intervention: before each complete forward Transformer block's normal
  backward operation. Its output affects that block's parameter gradients and
  all preceding layers.
- Identity anchor: a zero-initialized residual gate makes the centre backward
  rule exactly ordinary backpropagation at initialization.
- Gradient constraint: modified gradients are rescaled to preserve the
  original per-example RMS.
- Inner training: initially 10 sequential Adam updates with batch size 64. All
  candidates in a generation receive the same initialization and batches.
- Forward reset: every EGGROLL generation samples a new forward initialization;
  no forward parameters persist between generations.
- Fitness: reduction in cross-entropy on all 512 clean fitness examples.
- Initial population: 32 rank-one antithetic directions, giving 64 candidates.
  The implementation must support population growth through 1,024 candidates
  using chunks.
- EGGROLL: rank-one matrix perturbations, antithetic candidates, standard
  fitness normalization, and the paper-style direct SGD centre update.
- Horizon curriculum: start at 10 updates and increase the evolved horizon
  when progress saturates. Forward models always train from initialization for
  the complete current horizon.
- Baselines are supporting diagnostics, not the primary implementation focus.

## Evidence requirements

Before interpreting learned-backward results:

1. A centre rule with zero gates must produce exactly the same loss and forward
   parameter gradients as ordinary backpropagation.
2. Antithetic candidates must receive exact positive and negative versions of
   the same rank-one perturbations.
3. Candidate forward models and Adam states must reset every generation.
4. Candidates within one generation must see identical biased batches and the
   same clean fitness examples.
5. Ordinary Adam must be able to learn the genuine pointer task from clean
   examples, while biased-only training should expose shortcut reliance.
6. Report correct-leak, masked-leak, and incorrect-leak accuracy separately.

## Run log

### 2026-07-26: scalar CPU smoke

- Command: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m
  list_sorting_transformer.shortcut_credit_experiment` with two generations,
  four candidates, horizon two, width 32, and 16 fitness examples.
- Result: completed both generations, wrote metrics and resumable checkpoints,
  and exercised the real custom-backward hook and EGGROLL update.
- Focused tests: `6 passed`.
- Full repository tests: `154 passed`.
- Identity evidence: the zero-gate rule produced bit-exact loss and forward
  parameter gradients relative to ordinary backpropagation.
- Perturbation evidence: matrix perturbations were rank one, antithetic
  candidates averaged exactly to the centre, and the paper update moved every
  parameter along the fitter perturbation.
- Calibration finding: `sigma=0.02` was much too conservative. The first
  candidate's mean gradient cosine was about `0.9999998` and its correction RMS
  was only about `0.0005` of the ordinary gradient. Do not launch the real run
  with this value; calibrate on GPU toward approximately `0.99` cosine first.
